								<p>In the financial service industry, there is a need for an application which can take data from the internet and 
						let the user manipulate it in different ways. This is really important for making important decisions such as:</p>
						
							<p>-Purchasing</p>
							<p>-Selling</p>
							<p>-Holding on to a stock</p>
							<p>-Any other future decisions</p>
						
						<p>
							We were tasked with creating a time series manipulation app for Morgan Stanley in C# and WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation). 
							Its purpose is to empower traders and allow them to analyze time series data in more depth. Our application should allow the user
							 to import their own timeseries data and analyze it using exising financial functions or user-defined functions on the 
							 text editor/command line using the scripting language. In addition, they should have the ability to store and manage their own scripts, and also upload them to a server and run them on a schedule.</p>
							<p>The current time series app the traders use is unable to perform sophisticated functions in the command line.
							 It is only capable of performing basic functions such as adding 2 graphs.

						</p>
					<p>With our app, the traders will be able to visualize the neccessary data and manipulate them in different ways such as:
Date, volatility, and price of a stock with our lagging, smoothing and returns function respectively in order to make the best decision.</p>
